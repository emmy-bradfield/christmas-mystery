      <p> ...a question I'm sure you asked yourself as soon as you loaded
this wonderful website, was "what?" That's fair, it is an odd way to deliver
a Christmas Gift, sure. An annoying one, in fact. See, for you to get your
 lovely treat you must solve a series of complicated puzzles designed to 
ensure you are worth of such delight. Or, alternatively, to just make me 
and James giggle a bit. Yeah, that's mostly the purpose. Anyway, the space 
below is reserved for James to do whatever (as I put the rest of the site 
together) so enjoy whatever that turns out to be: </p>
